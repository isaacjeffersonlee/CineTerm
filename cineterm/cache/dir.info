In this project the cache system is implemented as follows:

We update the movies database and then store the results in a pandas dataframe
and then save this as a pickle file. This is much faster and more compact than
storing and reading as a csv.

Then everytime the app starts we load this pickle file into a dataframe object
and we can fuzzy search for movie title names.
